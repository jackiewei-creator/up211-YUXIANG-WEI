# Introduction to 221 GIS and Spatial Data Science
This course explores spatial data science, using Python to transform urban data into meaningful insights. It covers data acquisition, analysis, and visualization to address issues like social justice and transportation. Weekly assignments encourage critical thinking and real-world applications.
Key learning objectives include:

• Understanding the role of spatial data in addressing urban and social issues

• Developing frameworks to clean, organize, and prepare data for analysis

• Leveraging Python programming to perform spatial analysis and create informative visualizations

• Communicating insights through maps, charts, and reports that support evidence-based decision-making

By the end of the course, students will be equipped to use spatial data to drive impactful research and inform solutions to real-world urban problems.

# Personal Introduction
Wei Yuxiang - MS Transportation Engineering 2025 - [wyx011018@g.ucla.edu]

Yuxiang is a first-year master’s student in Transportation Engineering at UCLA. He enjoys traveling and watching movies in his free time. Proficient in Python, R, and C, he is eager to apply his programming skills to transportation research and urban mobility projects.

# Objectives
My primary objective for this course is to build a strong foundation in GIS and enhance my Python programming skills for spatial data analysis. I aim to learn how to acquire, process, and visualize spatial data to address real-world urban transportation challenges. By the end of the course, I hope to confidently apply GIS tools and Python-based methods in my research and future projects, contributing to innovative solutions in transportation engineering and urban planning.

# Project Ideas
1.	Public Transit Accessibility Analysis
    Map and analyze public transit access in Los Angeles to identify underserved communities and suggest improvements for equitable transportation.
2.	Traffic Congestion Hotspot Mapping
    Identify traffic congestion hotspots using spatial data to explore patterns and recommend strategies for improved traffic flow.
3.	Tourist Mobility and Urban Impact
    Analyze tourist travel patterns in Los Angeles to understand their impact on local transportation and propose mobility enhancements.
